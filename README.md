## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a quiz application built with React, utilizing the useReducer hook to manage the application's state. The app fetches quiz questions from an external API and transitions through various stages: loading, ready, active, and finished. Users can answer multiple-choice questions within a set time limit, with points awarded for correct answers. The application tracks progress, displays a timer, and allows users to restart the quiz after completion. Key components include a progress tracker, timer, question display, and a high score system, providing an interactive quiz experience.
